  <h1>Nyama Choma Recipe</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 kg beef or goat meat, cut into large chunks</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the minced garlic, vegetable oil, paprika, ground cumin, black pepper, salt, and lemon juice to make a marinade.</li>
      <li>Add the meat chunks to the marinade and toss well to coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and let the meat marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight for the best flavor.</li>
      <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off.</li>
      <li>Grill the meat on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until it is nicely charred and cooked to your desired level of doneness. This may take around 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of the meat.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, remove the meat from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Slice the Nyama Choma into smaller pieces and serve it hot with Kachumbari (tomato and onion salad) and your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious Nyama Choma!</p>
