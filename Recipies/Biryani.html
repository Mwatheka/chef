  <h1>Biryani Recipe</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
      <li>1 pound chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped mint leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fried onions (optional, for garnish)</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnish.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot with the remaining onions. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, ginger-garlic paste, and salt to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes are softened.</li>
      <li>Add the plain yogurt, chopped mint leaves, and chopped cilantro leaves to the pot. Stir well to combine.</li>
      <li>Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pot. Pour in the water and gently stir everything together.</li>
      <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the biryani simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the flavors have melded together.</li>
      <li>Remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Garnish with the reserved fried onions, if desired.</li>
      <li>Serve the flavorful Biryani hot with raita or a side salad.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious Biryani!</p>
