    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 cup boiled and mashed potatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup green peas</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely chopped carrots</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onions</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Add vegetable oil and mix well to form a crumbly texture.</li>
    <li>Add water gradually and knead to form a smooth dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
    <li>Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent.</li>
    <li>Add chopped carrots, green peas, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder (if using). Mix well and cook for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Add mashed potatoes and salt. Mix everything together and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and add chopped fresh cilantro. Mix well and let the filling cool.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a thin, circular shape.</li>
    <li>Cut the circular dough into halves, creating two semi-circles.</li>
    <li>Take one semi-circle, wet the straight edge with water, and form a cone by bringing the two ends together. Press the edges to seal.</li>
    <li>Fill the cone with the prepared vegetable filling and seal the top by pressing the edges firmly.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
    <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep pan or skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the samosas into the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve the Vegetable Samosas hot with chutney or sauce of your choice.</li>
