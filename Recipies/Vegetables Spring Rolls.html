  <h1>Vegetable Spring Rolls Recipe</h1>
  
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 spring roll wrappers</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded carrots</li>
    <li>1/2 cup bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sliced bell peppers</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
    <li>Sweet chili sauce or dipping sauce of your choice (for serving)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the sliced bell peppers and mushrooms to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few minutes until slightly softened.</li>
    <li>Add the shredded cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, and green onions to the skillet. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and sugar. Pour the sauce over the vegetable mixture in the skillet. Stir well to combine and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and let the filling cool.</li>
    <li>Take one spring roll wrapper and place it on a clean surface in a diamond shape, with one corner facing you.</li>
    <li>Spoon a portion of the vegetable filling onto the bottom corner of the wrapper, leaving some space on the sides. Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold the sides inward. Roll up tightly towards the remaining corner, sealing the edges with a bit of water.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining spring roll wrappers and filling.</li>
    <li>In a deep frying pan or wok, heat enough oil for deep frying over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the spring rolls into the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve the Vegetable Spring Rolls hot with sweet chili sauce or your preferred dipping sauce.</li>
