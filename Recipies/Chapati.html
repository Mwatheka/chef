  <h1>Chapati Recipe</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
      <li>Add the warm water gradually while kneading the dough with your hands. Continue kneading until you have a smooth and elastic dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add a little more water.</li>
      <li>Drizzle the vegetable oil over the dough and knead again for a few minutes to incorporate the oil.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into small golf ball-sized portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball using your hands.</li>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, take one dough ball and roll it out into a thin, round chapati using a rolling pin. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch.</li>
      <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled chapati on the heated skillet and cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until small bubbles start to form on the surface.</li>
      <li>Flip the chapati and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until lightly browned and cooked through. Press down gently with a spatula to help it cook evenly.</li>
      <li>Remove the cooked chapati from the skillet and place it on a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.</li>
      <li>Serve the hot and freshly cooked Chapatis with your favorite curry or dish.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade Chapatis!</p>
