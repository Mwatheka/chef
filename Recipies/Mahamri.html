  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or ghee</li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and ground cardamom. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Add the coconut milk and warm water to the dry ingredients. Knead the dough until it becomes soft and pliable.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 1 hour to allow it to rise.</li>
      <li>After the resting period, divide the dough into small portions and shape them into round discs or triangles.</li>
      <li>In a deep frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Gently place the shaped dough into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides. Flip them occasionally for even cooking.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, remove the mahamri from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
      <li>Serve the warm mahamri with tea or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious Mahamri!</p>
