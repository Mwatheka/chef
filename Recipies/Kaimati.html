  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>Honey or syrup for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, instant yeast, ground cardamom, and salt.</li>
      <li>Add the warm water gradually while stirring the mixture with a spoon. Mix well until you have a smooth batter. The consistency should be thick but pourable.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
      <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Gently stir the batter to deflate it slightly. Using a tablespoon, drop small portions of the batter into the hot oil, creating round or irregular-shaped fritters. Fry them in batches, but do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
      <li>Fry the Kaimati until they turn golden brown, flipping them occasionally to ensure even cooking. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes per batch.</li>
      <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried Kaimati onto a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
      <li>Drizzle the Kaimati with honey or syrup while they are still warm.</li>
      <li>Allow the Kaimati to cool slightly before serving. They are best enjoyed fresh and warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your sweet and crispy Kaimati!</p>
