        Start by making the dough:
        <ol>
          <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
          <li>Add ghee or vegetable oil and mix it well with the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
          <li>Gradually add cold water while kneading the dough until it forms a smooth and firm consistency.</li>
          <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Prepare the filling:
        <ol>
          <li>In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
          <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</li>
          <li>Add grated ginger and chopped green chilies, and sauté for a minute.</li>
          <li>Add boiled and mashed potatoes, boiled green peas, coriander powder, garam masala, turmeric powder, and salt to taste.</li>
          <li>Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the filling is well combined and heated through.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat and let the filling cool down.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Shape the samosas:
        <ol>
          <li>Take a small portion of the dough and roll it into a thin circle.</li>
          <li>Cut the circle in half.</li>
          <li>Take one half and fold it into a cone shape, overlapping the edges.</li>
          <li>Fill the cone with the prepared filling.</li>
          <li>Moisten the edges of the cone with water and press to seal the samosa.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Fry the samosas:
        <ol>
          <li>In a deep pan or pot, heat oil for frying over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add the shaped samosas to the hot oil and fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
          <li>Remove the fried samosas from the oil and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Serve and enjoy:
        <ol>
