  <h1>Homemade Pizza Recipe</h1>
  
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>Pizza sauce</li>
    <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the warm water and olive oil.</li>
    <li>Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and divide it into desired portions (e.g., two for personal-sized pizzas).</li>
    <li>Roll out each portion of dough into a round shape to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, or any other ingredients you prefer.</li>
    <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
