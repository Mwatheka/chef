  <h1>Homemade Doughnut Recipe</h1>
  
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk (at room temperature)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Oil for frying (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Roll it out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
    <li>Using a doughnut cutter or a round biscuit cutter, cut out doughnut shapes from the dough. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Cover the doughnuts with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes until they puff up.</li>
    <li>While the doughnuts are rising, heat the oil in a deep fryer or a large pot to about 350°F (175°C).</li>
    <li>Carefully drop a few doughnuts into the hot oil and fry for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn golden brown. Fry them in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
    <li>Once fried, transfer the doughnuts onto a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li>To make the glaze, in a bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.</li>
    <li>Dip each doughnut into the glaze while they are still warm. You can also add toppings like sprinkles, shredded coconut, or chopped nuts if desired.</li>
    <li>Place the glazed doughnuts on a wire rack to allow the glaze to set.</li>
    <li>Serve the homemade doughnuts fresh and enjoy!</li>
