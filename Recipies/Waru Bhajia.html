  <h1>Waru Bhajia Recipe</h1>
  
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large potatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup chickpea flour (besan)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup rice flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water (as needed for the batter)</li>
    <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin rounds or matchstick shapes. Place them in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, rice flour, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Gradually add water to the dry ingredients, whisking continuously, until you achieve a smooth and thick batter consistency. The batter should be thick enough to coat the potato slices.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Drain the potato slices and pat them dry with a kitchen towel to remove excess water.</li>
    <li>Dip each potato slice into the prepared batter, ensuring it is coated on all sides. Allow any excess batter to drip off.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the coated potato slices into the hot oil, a few at a time, without overcrowding the pan. Fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy, flipping them occasionally to cook evenly.</li>
    <li>Once fried, remove the bhajias using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining potato slices until all the bhajias are fried.</li>
    <li>Serve the Waru Bhajia hot with your favorite chutney, ketchup, or tamarind sauce for dipping.</li>
